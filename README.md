### Fiddling with Local Authentication in Objective-C ###

This is a simple project to demonstrate logging in with Local Authentication/Touch ID and using Local Authentication/Touch ID to add and remove an item from the keychain.

It was created during iOS D8 Night #1 (https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ios-d8-night-tickets-11856883257).

Currently, retrieving items from the keychain doesn't appear to work. My bet is this is a bug with iOS 8, but I'm going to look into this properly soon!

This is *not* production code, it's just for fun/learning :)

Enjoy!
